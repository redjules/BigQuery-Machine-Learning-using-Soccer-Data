# BigQuery Machine Learning using Soccer Data

The data used in this project comes from the following sources:

Pappalardo et al., (2019) A public data set of spatio-temporal match events in soccer competitions, Nature Scientific Data 6:236, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0247-7
Pappalardo et al. (2019) PlayerRank: Data-driven Performance Evaluation and Player Ranking in Soccer via a Machine Learning Approach. ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technologies (TIST) 10, 5, Article 59 (September 2019), 27 pages. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/3343172

In this project, I have:

- Written functions in BigQuery to help with calculations to be performed on soccer shot data
- Created and evaluated "expected goals" models using BigQuery ML
- Applied an expected goals model to "new" data using BigQuery ML
